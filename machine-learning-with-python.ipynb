    "    We will be using the <strong>Scikit Learn</strong> package.\n",
    "    <br>It's the most popular machine learning package for Python and has a lot of algorithms built-in!\n",

    "    Every algorithm is exposed in scikit-learn via an \"Estimator\", first you'll import the model, the general form is:\n",

    "    <br><code>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression</code>\n",
    "    <br><br><strong>Estimator parameters:</strong>\n",
    "    <br>All the parameters of an estimator can be set when it is instantiated, and have suitable default values\n",
    "    <br>You can use <code>Shift + Tab</code> in jupyter to check the possible parameters\n",
    "    <br><strong>For example:</strong>\n",
    "    <br><code>model = LinearRegression(normalize=True)\n",

    "    <br><br>Scikit-learn strives to have a uniform interface across all methods, and we'll see examples of these below\n",
    "    <br>Given a scikit-learn estimator object named model, the following methods are available...\n",
    "    <br>Available in <strong>all Estimators</strong>\n",
    "    <li>model.fit(): fit training data</li>\n",
    "    <li>For supervised learning applications, this accepts two arguments: the data X and the labels y (e. g. model.fit(X, y))</li>\n",
    "    <li>For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data X (e. g. model.fit(X))</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>Available in <strong>supervised estimators</strong>\n",
    "    <li>model.predict(): given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data X_new (e. g. model.predict(X_new)), and returns the learned label for each object in the array</li>\n",
    "    <li>model.predict_proba(): For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returnes by model.predict()</li>\n",
    "    <li>model.score(): for classification or regression problems, most estimators implement a score method. Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit</li>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>Available in <strong>unsupervised estimators</strong>\n",
    "    <li>model.predict(): predict labels in clustering algorithms</li>\n",
    "    <li>model.transform(): given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. This also accepts one argument X_new, and returns the new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model</li>\n",
    "    <li>model.fit_transform(): some estimators implement this method, wich more efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data</li>\n",
