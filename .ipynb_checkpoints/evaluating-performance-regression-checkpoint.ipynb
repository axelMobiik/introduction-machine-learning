    "<h1>Evaluating Performance - Regression</h1>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Let's take a moment now to discuss evaluating Regression Models. \n",
    "    <br>Regression is a task when a model attempts to predict continuous values (unlike categorical values, which is classification).\n",
    "    <br>You may have heard of some evaluation metrics like accuracy or recall.\n",
    "    <br>These sort of metrics aren't useful for regression problems, we need metrics designed for <strong>continuous</strong> values!\n",
    "    <br>For example, attempting to predict the price of a house given it's features is a <strong>regression task</strong>.\n",
    "    <br>Attempting to predict the country a house is in given it's features would be a classification task\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Let' discuss some of the most common evaluation metrics for regression:</p>\n",
    "<li>Mean Absolute Error</li>\n",
    "<li>Mean Squared Error</li>\n",
    "<li>Root Mean Square Error</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)<br>\n",
    "    <li>This is the mean of the absolute value of errors</li>\n",
    "    <li>MAE won't punish large errors however</li>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Mean Squared Error (MSE)<br>\n",
    "    <li>This is the mean of the squared errors</li>\n",
    "    <li>Larger errors are noted more than MAE, making MSE more popular</li>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)<br>\n",
    "    <li>This is the root of the mean of the squared errors</li>\n",
    "    <li>Most popular(has same units as y)</li>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Most common question from students: \"Is this value of RMSE good?\"\n",
    "    <br>Context is everything!\n",
    "    <br>A RSME of $10 is fantastic for predicting the price of a house, but horrible for predicting the price of a candy bar!\n",
    "    <br>Compare your error metric to the average value of the label in your data set to try to get an intuition of its overall performance\n",
    "    <br>Domain knowledge also plays an important role here!\n",
    "</p>"
